<h1 align="center">Galaxy Python Aplication</h1>

<p> My application, used to learn programming, find solutions to programming and technical problems. In addition, the application includes an entertainment module that contains several games written by me, as well as a technical module that solves various technical problems mainly in aeronautical engineering. 

<br>
The application is "young", I started working on it so I am slowly building and updating it. On an ongoing basis, information about newly added functionality will appear in README.md.

<br>
I am currently building the framework of the application in Tkinter.
